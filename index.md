I'm Josh, and I like seeing how code can help people be more successful and live better lives - and I have a ton of fun learning new things and building stuff.

I am on a learning journey, finishing a degree in computer science, eager to get involved in the world of software engineering. 

This is a place for me to ask questions, explain things I've learned, or document my projects. Feel free to correct me or ask questions. Thanks for taking a look.
